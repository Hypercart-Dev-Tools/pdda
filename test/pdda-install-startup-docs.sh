# test/pdda-install-startup-docs.sh — GH-23 P1 + GH-25.
#
# Two defects lived in the same four lines of install.sh:
#
#   GH-23 P1  --with-startup-docs copied the canonical repo's own ROUTER.md verbatim, so every target
#             was told to run install.sh and utils/pdda/pdda-sync.sh — neither of which a target has.
#   GH-25     copy_runtime has no create-only guard, so the same flag silently destroyed a
#             repo-authored AGENTS.md (61,829 bytes in LTVera-Pandas) with PDDA's 2,289-byte stub.
#
# These tests pin the fix: ROUTER.md is written from templates/ROUTER.target.md, and the startup docs
# are create-only unless --force.
