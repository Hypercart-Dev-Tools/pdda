# ROUTER.md

This file is the first entry point for an AI agent working in this repo: it tells you what to read, what to run, and which files are canonical.

## Role split

- `ROUTER.md` = startup order and canonical entry points
- `AGENTS.md` = behavioral rules, decision quality, reversibility, blast radius, proof
- `README.md` = human-facing repo/product overview
- `ROADMAP.md` = pointer ledger of queued, current, completed, attempted, and deferred work
- `CHANGELOG.md` = the end-of-iteration running log (first-class PDDA artifact; governed by `PROJECT/PDDA.md`)
- `PROJECT/**` docs = canonical execution detail for a specific effort
- `PROJECT/PDDA.md` = document contract and automation rules (incl. the CHANGELOG contract)

## Startup sequence

1. Read `ROUTER.md` to understand the repo's operating order and canonical files. -> expect one clear next file, not a repo-wide scavenger hunt.
2. Read `AGENTS.md` before making recommendations or edits. -> expect explicit assumptions, a reversibility read on consequential changes, and verified claims only.
3. Read `ROADMAP.md` to find the active effort or parked intake. -> expect links outward to the canonical `PROJECT/**` docs; `ROADMAP.md` is a pointer ledger, not a plan body.
4. Read the linked `PROJECT/**` document that owns the work you are touching. -> expect the near-top `## Status` table to tell you what was just completed and what is next.
5. If the task touches project docs, read `PROJECT/PDDA.md` and follow the PDDA contract. -> expect `PROJECT/2-WORKING` docs to have frontmatter, the exact status table, and QA gates when phased.
6. Before reporting success on code or runtime work, run `./validate.sh`. -> expect the suite to stay green; do not claim completion if it fails or was skipped.
7. Before reporting success on doc-hygiene or roadmap work, run `utils/pdda-run.sh` or the relevant `utils/pdda-*.sh` check. -> expect deterministic findings first, then any LLM review.

## Canonical rules

- Do not put phase checklists, build steps, or deep execution notes in `ROADMAP.md`.
- Every active doc in `PROJECT/2-WORKING/` must be reflected by a pointer in `ROADMAP.md` — a one-line ledger entry that links it. A working doc that should not appear opts out with `roadmap_exempt: true` in its frontmatter. Enforced by `utils/pdda-check-roadmap-coverage.sh`; governance lives in `PROJECT/PDDA.md` → "ROADMAP.md contract".
- Every captured GitHub issue doc in `PROJECT/1-INBOX/GH-*.md` must also be parked in `ROADMAP.md` as a one-line queue entry immediately at intake, then promoted or removed later. Enforced by `utils/pdda-check-roadmap-coverage.sh`; governance lives in `PROJECT/PDDA.md` → "GitHub issue intake" + "ROADMAP.md contract".
- Do not create a second competing plan when a canonical `PROJECT/**` doc already exists.
- Issue-first: any change beyond a **2–3 line** fix opens a GitHub issue first, then a pointer doc **named after the issue** (`GH-<number>-VERY-SHORT-DESC.md`, e.g. `GH-1234-SHOWME-COMMAND.md`), and that capture is **parked in `ROADMAP.md` immediately** before execution begins. The issue is the signal stream; the pointer doc is the execution surface of record. Genuinely trivial edits (≤2–3 line fixes, typos, path repoints, doc-only one-liners) are exempt. Governed by `PROJECT/PDDA.md` → "GitHub issue intake".
- Do not override deterministic PDDA findings with prose.
- Do not report a win you did not verify with the relevant script or test.
- Update `CHANGELOG.md` at the end of each iteration; its governance lives in `PROJECT/PDDA.md` — do not re-specify CHANGELOG rules in `AGENTS.md` or elsewhere.

## Command rails

For repo correctness:

```bash
./validate.sh
```

For document hygiene:

```bash
utils/pdda-run.sh
```

For targeted PDDA debugging:

```bash
utils/pdda-check-frontmatter.sh
utils/pdda-check-status-table.sh
utils/pdda-check-hardcoded-paths.sh
utils/pdda-check-roadmap.sh
utils/pdda-check-roadmap-coverage.sh
utils/pdda-stale-working-docs.sh
utils/pdda-doc-ready.sh   # LLM readiness review — set PDDA_LLM_BIN (codex/claude/agy) for recommendations, else it self-skips
```

## Routing hints

- If the task is about current priorities or active work, start in `ROADMAP.md`, then follow the linked `PROJECT/**` doc.
- If the task is about fresh GitHub intake or duplicate-prevention, start in `ROADMAP.md`'s queue, then follow the linked `PROJECT/1-INBOX/GH-*.md` capture doc.
- If the task is about document quality, active-doc lifecycle, roadmap sprawl, or automation policy, start in `PROJECT/PDDA.md`.
- If the task is about the CHANGELOG, provenance, or end-of-iteration logging, the governance is in `PROJECT/PDDA.md` (the "CHANGELOG.md — end-of-iteration record" contract).
- If the task is about the `tick` runtime, event projection, or multi-agent coordination kernel, start in `README.md`, then `bin/`, `src/`, `test/`, and the active project doc.
- If the task is about a proposed roadmap-steward agent, start here, then read `PROJECT/PDDA.md` and its `Proposed roadmap steward extension` section.
- Issue-first SOP: any change beyond a 2–3 line fix (and every project plan) opens a GitHub issue *first*, then gets a pointer doc named after the issue at `PROJECT/1-INBOX/GH-<number>-VERY-SHORT-DESC.md` — e.g. `GH-1234-SHOWME-COMMAND.md` — and that capture is parked in the `ROADMAP.md` queue immediately (format + lifecycle owned by `PROJECT/PDDA.md` → "GitHub issue intake"), following the normal `1-INBOX` → `2-WORKING` flow. Genuinely trivial edits (≤2–3 line fixes, typos, path repoints, doc-only one-liners) are exempt and commit directly.
