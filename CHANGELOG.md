### Standalone installer baseline reset

Reset the copied `xyz`-specific repo surface into a standalone PDDA installer baseline.

- Replaced the inherited `ROADMAP.md` and `ROUTER.md` with repo-local versions that describe `pdda` itself.
- Added the missing `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, and `.pdda-mode` so the startup path is self-consistent.
- Updated `utils/PDDA-INSTALL.md` so the canonical install set and required target-repo files match the live PDDA suite.
- Normalized the scaffold placeholders to `blank.md` so baseline scaffolding is ignored by the checks as intended.

Verification: `./utils/pdda-run.sh`
