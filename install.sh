# PDDA installer — drop the Project-Driven Doc Automation surface into ANOTHER repo in a clean,

#
#   ./install.sh /path/to/your-repo
#
# It copies the shipped runtime — exactly the set declared in utils/pdda/pdda-sync-manifest.conf and
# expanded by utils/pdda/pdda-manifest.sh (the SAME manifest pdda-sync.sh pushes, so the install set
# and the steady-state push set can never drift) — creates the PROJECT/** lifecycle tree, and
# SYNTHESISES blank seed ledger/changelog/activity/mode files. It never copies this repo's own
# ROADMAP/CHANGELOG/activity content, so the target starts empty but immediately valid. Existing
# target files are never clobbered unless you pass --force.
#
# Re-running it upgrades in place. If the target predates the utils/pdda/ subfolder (runtime kept
# FLAT under utils/), it auto-migrates to the canonical layout: removes the duplicate PDDA-owned flat
# files and repoints old-path references. Disable with --no-migrate.

PDDA installer — install Project-Driven Doc Automation into a target repo.

Usage:
  ./install.sh [options] <target-repo-dir>

Options:
  --force                Overwrite existing seed files (ROADMAP.md, CHANGELOG.md, .pdda-mode,
                         blank.md placeholders) and startup-doc scaffolds. Runtime scripts +
                         PROJECT/PDDA.md are always refreshed. Never touches your real PROJECT/** docs.
  --with-startup-docs    Also install the operator read-order scaffold: ROUTER.md (written from
                         templates/ROUTER.target.md — the canonical repo's own ROUTER.md is NOT
                         copied), AGENTS.md, GUIDING-PRINCIPLES.md, and the /pdda re-orient skill.
                         The three docs are create-only: an existing file is kept, not overwritten
                         (use --force). The /pdda skill is runtime and always refreshed.
                         When ROUTER.md is written, a post-install self-check asserts that every
                         *.sh it names exists in the target; a failure exits non-zero (a PDDA
                         template bug). A ROUTER.md that was kept is never validated.
  --no-migrate           Skip auto-migration of a pre-utils/pdda/ (flat) layout. By default, when the
                         target keeps the runtime flat under utils/, install removes the duplicate
                         PDDA-owned flat files and repoints old-path references to utils/pdda/.
  --no-register          Skip recording this install in the per-user registry
                         (default: $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/pdda/registry.tsv or ~/.config/pdda/registry.tsv;
                         override with PDDA_REGISTRY). The registry is machine-local and never committed.
                         Also skips the multi-device git-pulse projection (see below).
  --mode <m>             Initial .pdda-mode: observe (default) | light | full.
  --quad                 Enable the opt-in Quad Concepts layer (seeds .pdda-quad=on). Off by default;
                         orthogonal to --mode. Requires a "## Quad Concepts" section (1-4 bullets) on
                         plan docs; see PROJECT/PDDA.md. Opt a doc out with quad_exempt: true.
  -h, --help             This message.

What gets installed (zero state):
  utils/pdda/{pdda.sh,pdda-lib.sh,pdda-doc-ready.sh,pdda-catchup.sh,pdda-gh-refresh.sh}   (runtime, refreshed)
  PROJECT/PDDA.md                                            (the contract, refreshed)
  PROJECT/{1-INBOX,2-WORKING,3-COMPLETED,4-MISC}/blank.md    (lifecycle buckets)
  ROADMAP.md CHANGELOG.md PROJECT/PDDA-ACTIVITY.jsonl .pdda-mode .pdda-quad   (blank seeds, create-only)
  .gitignore += PROJECT/PDDA-ACTIVITY.jsonl .pdda-gh-state.tsv     (churning runtime state)

It also records the install in a per-user, machine-local registry (~/.config/pdda/registry.tsv) so
pdda-sync.sh knows where every copy lives. The registry is never committed. --no-register skips it.

If git-pulse (a GitHub-backed activity-sync tool) is present, the installer additionally drops a
path-normalized projection of the registry (repo name + date + source commit + mode; never absolute
paths) into git-pulse's repo under pdda/, and git-pulse's own sync carries that status across your
devices. Best-effort and fail-open — absent git-pulse it is silently skipped. The git-pulse checkout is
auto-detected (git-pulse's config.sh sync_repo_dir, then common locations); set PDDA_GITPULSE_DIR to
override or to a nonexistent path to disable. The local registry remains the source of truth.

After install it runs `utils/pdda/pdda.sh run` in the target so you see it working immediately.

#
# Assert that every `*.sh` path named in the ROUTER.md we just WROTE resolves to a file that exists in
# the target. This single assertion would have caught the whole of GH-23 at install time: for months
# `--with-startup-docs` copied the canonical repo's own router into every target, telling agents to run
# `install.sh` and `utils/pdda/pdda-sync.sh` — neither of which a target has. No check saw it, because
# `pdda-check-governance` only scans `.md` references (that gap is GH-23 P3).
#
# Two boundaries, both learned the hard way:
#
#   1. Only validate a file we WROTE. If --with-startup-docs kept the operator's existing ROUTER.md,
#      that file is theirs; failing their install over their own scripts would be indefensible.
#   2. Run it against the written artifact, not the source template. P1's first draft of
#      templates/ROUTER.target.md reintroduced the exact bug it exists to fix (it told targets a local
#      edit "is overwritten on the next `pdda-sync.sh push`"), and only an assertion on the OUTPUT
#      caught it. Checking the input would have passed.
#

# Roadmap

> **Pointer/ledger only — not a plan body.** Execution detail (phase checklists, build steps, QA
> gates, deep notes) lives in the linked \`PROJECT/**\` docs; keep it there. See the contract banner above.

## Status

| What was just completed | What's next |
|---|---|
| Installed PDDA ($TODAY). | Open a \`PROJECT/**\` doc for the first tracked effort and add its pointer here. |

## Ledger

### Queue / parked intake

- No parked intake docs.

### In progress

- No active \`PROJECT/2-WORKING\` docs.

### Completed

- No completed docs.

### Deferred

- No deferred docs.

# CHANGELOG.md

Newest-first, dated end-of-iteration record. One entry per substantive iteration: what changed,
why, and the verification. See \`PROJECT/PDDA.md\` for the full contract.

## $TODAY

### PDDA installed

- Installed the PDDA document-automation surface (\`utils/pdda/pdda.sh\` + helpers, \`PROJECT/PDDA.md\`)
  and the \`PROJECT/**\` lifecycle tree in \`observe\` mode.
- Next: replace this entry as real iterations land.
